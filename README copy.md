## 📌 About This Repository
This repository contains my daily coding exercises aimed at **logic building and problem-solving**.  
All code is uploaded **directly in the root folder**, in mixed languages (C, C++, Java), e.g., `program34.c`, `program35.cpp`, `Program36.java`.

For each problem, I try to improve the solution step by step:

1. **Simple/Basic Version** – basic logic to solve the problem  
2. **Optimized Version** – smarter logic, better efficiency  
3. **Improved Version** – further time/space optimization  

This way, I can track how my coding logic and efficiency improve over time.

## 🚀 Practice Highlights
- Over **200 mixed-language programs**  
- Problems include: factorials, primes, patterns, arrays, loops, recursion, simple algorithms, etc.  
- Most problems are solved **in multiple versions** to improve logic and efficiency  

Example workflow for a single problem:  
- **Factorial**  
  1. Basic loop method  
  2. Using recursion  
  3. Optimized version (reducing complexity)  

This pattern is repeated across many problems to strengthen **problem-solving and logical thinking**.

## 🎯 Goal
- Daily coding practice  
- Build strong **logic and algorithm skills**  
- Track **improvements in coding efficiency**  
- Practice multiple languages simultaneously
