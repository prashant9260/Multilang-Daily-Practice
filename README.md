# multilang-daily-practice

This repository contains my daily coding practice focused on **logic building** using **C, C++, and Java**.  
The goal is to improve problem-solving skills, strengthen fundamentals, and build consistency through regular coding.

## 🔍 Purpose
- Strengthen logical thinking  
- Practice problem-solving daily  
- Improve coding skills in C, C++, and Java  
- Build a habit of writing clean and efficient code  

## 📌 About the Code
- Each program focuses on **logic building**, pattern problems, loops, functions, arrays, basic algorithms, etc.
- Code from all three languages is stored together (mixed language repository).
- Updated regularly with new problems and solutions.

## 🛠 Languages Used
- C  
- C++  
- Java  

## 🚀 Goal
Write and upload at least one logic-building program every day.
